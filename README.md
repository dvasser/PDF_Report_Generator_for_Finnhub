### How to use PDF_Report_Generator_for_Finnhub:
In order to use this PDF report generator you will need to import the FinnhubConnector object from my other repository: https://github.com/dvasser/Finnhub-API-Connector as well as get a free api key from Finnhub. How the program works - you simply input as many stocks as you want in a list, (could be length =1), and a date range. The program then makes API calls to get fincancial performance info of these stocks in the given date range, creates data frames, plots them using MatPlotLib, makes screenshots of figures and outputs them to PDF all while formatting it neatly for better visualization. Using this generator you will be able to compare the performance of any stocks that the free API connection allows (almost all North American stocks) in any desired date range. Just make sure that all the stocks passed in exist within the given dates. Once you have your API key please download the .py file from the link above into your current directory and continue on to the .py file in this repository. You are now ready to run the code. In the .py file you will find precise directions on what to expect from the program and all the comments explaining the syntax. Also, there is a link included for MatPlotLib colors, feel free to click on it and change them around. I made the program according to my personal preference, but you can easily change the design by changing the colors that you find in the syntax using that link (line #584 of the .py file). You will also find two sample PDF reports that I generated using the program in the main repository file. Check them out to see how the final output looks like. Enjoy your research!
